## Description

This is a CLI based chess game. If you want to read about the rules of chess [this](http://www.chessvariants.org/d.chess/chess.html) is an excellent resource. This project was made as the final Ruby project for the [Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com/) Ruby section.

There were a number of new tools and patterns I used in this project. Most notably the Factory and Null Object patterns. It was an opportunity to flesh out my OOP skills, putting to use things like Inheritance and Polymorphism to a degree I hadn't done before. This was also my first experience working with ANSI escape codes, where in the past I had used gems like [colorize](https://github.com/fazibear/colorize)

The largest challenge about this project to me was the scale of it, most projects I have done so far were much smaller, and this is the first project I could really feel the benefits of OOP and effective abstractions.
